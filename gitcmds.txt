（make sure I am in the repot）
(open intergreate terminal)

use this for creating a new branch at begining of each lesson
git checkout -b name-of-the-new-branch

use these command for saving changes at the end of each lesson
git add -A
git commit -m "message of what youre commiting"
git push
(if it mentions something about setting the upstream branch after typing "git push" copy the command it prints out)

if Im confused what to do next, use this.
git status

I love Nick
